# Reinforcement Learning Assignment

:+1: **Reinforcement Learning Specification Assignment** 

In this assignment you will have to implement a reinforcement learning algorithm, which will allow the agent to learn from the environment.
You must modify the agent class in the **agent.py** file, in order to return an action given the current state and its reward.
You may use any active reinforcement learning algorithm, such as Active-TDRL, Q-learning, or SARSA.

### Source:
- **common.py**             - Constants and map reading method
- **game.py**               - Engine with drawing functions
- **environment.py**        - Agent environment
- **player.py**             - Character drawing calls
- **agent.py**              - Agent class

### Execution
- Execute interface with default map or filename.map
```
python -B game.py [filename.map]
```
- Execute terminal with default map or filename.map
```
python -B environment.py [filename.map]
```

### Report

You must deliver a 2-page report of your work, in the [AAAI conference format] (http://www.aaai.org/Publications/Templates/AuthorKit.zip)  containing:
 - An introduction;
 - One section describing the algorithm you chose and how you implemented it;
 - One experimentation section; and
 - One conclusion section.
